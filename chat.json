These discussions could range from \"how do I X?\" to \"What should we focus on first?\" and beyond.  The first step is to encourage people to join the slack team (so email me if you want an account) and to find a congenial date.  \n\nPersonally, Wednesday nights are out, and weekends are typically squiffy due to events, and I would like to hear from y'all which days\/nights would work for you.\n\nEowyn de Wever",
